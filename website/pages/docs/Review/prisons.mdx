In 1974, Robert Martinson published his interpretation of the findings in Public Interest, a conservative journal. Full report: Lipton , Martinson, Wilks 
1974 articles. Martinson went out and published articles on his own (even without coauthors knowing). Only after these, New York State published the research findings. 



So prisons don't work was the answer. That doesn't mean that everyone will be able to draw their own conclusion. 

Rehabilitation /Rehabilitative idea. 

Some people answered this as saying nothing works close prisons. Others said nothing works so keep them locked up. Prisons as incapacitation grew as a result.
